            <h4>pov: you randomly wake up in a small dark room with 2 doors and a tv. you have no idea on how you got here, you're trying remember what happened before and later remembered seeing 2 people with pig masks and black bags. 3 minutes later the tv turns on and you see a small guy on a bike and he says, "hi jessica, your in an escape room. there are 2 doors and you have to pick the right in order to escape. if you pick the wrong door you will never make it out of here and possibly die. behind the 1st door is a glass of ice water there may be something deadly inside of the water but you pick the 1st door you have to drink the water to make it out. And behind the 2nd door is a pool full of hungry sharks who hasnt eaten in 10 weeks. choose your path wisely and good luck" *evil lughs* </h4>
